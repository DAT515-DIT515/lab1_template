## Useful information for Lab1 submission

1) Once you accept the invitation to join the classroom, a private repository will be created for you in GitHub Classroom. This private repository will contain the following items:
    - Two input files in the "data" folder: "tramlines.txt" and "tramstops.json."
    - A test file ("lab1_student_test.py") that you should not modify.
    - A template ("tramdata.py") with the functions you need to implement and their related arguments. Please do not modify any function or argument names in the template.
2) Implement your solution in the "tramdata.py" file. You can add your own "helper" functions if needed.
3) Once you've finished, you must upload "tramdata.py" and the "tramnetwork.json" file generated to your repository.
4) After a few seconds, you'll be able to view the test results under the "Actions" section, specifically under "All workflows" and then "Autograding." Click on the latest build to see the results of the test. To view the test details, click on the bullet labelled "Run education/autograding@v1."

- Please note that the test is not exhaustive, so it's possible to achieve a 100% score and still have some errors in your code. The test is intended to provide you with an idea of the correctness of your solution.
- It's important not to modify the function names and argument names provided in "tramdata.py." Part of the goal for this course is learning how to work with and read documentation effectively.
